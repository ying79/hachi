# hachi 🐕

Public archive for my seminar notes and research-related materials.  
Named after **Hachi**, my energetic and affectionate dog — always running ahead,  
always excited about what’s next 🐾💨

I keep small traces of what I’ve learned here — notes, slides,  
and pieces from study sessions and seminars.

## 🌿 Structure
- **docs/** — contains all published notes (for GitHub Pages)  
  - `index.md` — homepage  
  - `UAV.md` — UAV section  
  - `mmWave.md` — mmWave section  
  - `references.md` — reference list  
- **images/** — figures used in the notes  

## 💡 About
While *kirara* — my quiet cat 🐱 — keeps the private notebook for drafts and rough ideas,  
*hachi* is the bright, outgoing side — where the organized notes live and run free.  
Together they make up both halves of my learning journey. 🐕✨
